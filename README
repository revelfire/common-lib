Changelog
---------

1.0
	* Initial public release.

Description
-----------
A collection of hand-tuned, ultra-fast classes used by most of the open source
and commercial software from The Buzz Media.

Many of the operations performed by this library (like searching an array for
a byte or char, or parsing a non-float number) are performed by other libraries
readily available from projects like Apache Commons; this functionality is
re-implemented in this library with a tight focus on performance and lower 
memory overhead at the expense of code duplication.

What that means is avoiding extremely deep method call-hierarchies for something
like indexOf(char[], char) calling down into a more specific method, then
another and another and another until finally ending up at some Abstract class
base implementation.

Benchmarks are provided to compare the library's performance to that of more
"standard" methods.


Performance
-----------
Benchmarks can be found in the /src/test/java folder and can be run directly
from the command line (no need to setup JUnit).

[Platform]
* Java 1.6.0_24 on Windows 7 64-bit 
* Dual Core Intel E6850 processor
* 8 GB of ram

[Benchmark Results]
indexOf byte		elapsed time: 12ms	(3,328,000 bytes scanned)
indexOf byte[]		elapsed time: 22ms	(3,328,000 bytes scanned)
indexOfAny byte[]	elapsed time: 23ms	(3,328,000 bytes scanned)

JDK Integer.parseInt 			elapsed time: 72ms	(1310720 numbers parsed, 6553600 bytes processed)
common-lib NumberUtils.parseInt elapsed time: 55ms	(1310720 numbers parsed, 9175000 bytes processed)


** A note about the Integer.parseInt comparison; the time required to read in the
sample file, decode it from byte[] to char[] and then convert those all into
String instances IS NOT INCLUDED in the benchmark timing. If you were to include
that, you would see both the  memory usage and CPU time of using 
Integer.parseInt to be significantly higher than NumberUtils.parseInt.


Runtime Requirements
--------------------
None.

There are currently no 3rd party dependencies required to use common-lib.


History
-------
While working on a few disparate projects (high performance XML parser,
Redis DB driver, CloudFront log parser, etc.) I noticed a pattern in the types
of utilities I was writing over and over again OR logic I was inlining directly
in my code.

I generalized this code and broke it out into this library so the handful of
projects maintained by The Buzz Media could more easily make use of the code.

I decided to open source the project because there is no proprietary magic in
any of this, the library is tuned to be fast with a small memory footprint and
I thought others might find it handy as opposed to using more bloated libs like
Apache Commons.
