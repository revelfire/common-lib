Filler text (also Placeholder text or Dummy text) is text that shares some characteristics of a real written text, but is random or otherwise generated. It may be used to display a sample of fonts, generate text for testing, or to spoof an e-mail spam filter. The process of using filler text is sometimes called Greeking, although the text itself may be nonsense, or largely Latin, as in Lorem ipsum.
