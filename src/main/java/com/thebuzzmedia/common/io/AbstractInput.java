	/**
	 * Used to perform the actual "read" logic based on the specific type of

	 * <p/>
	 * This operation should read <em>up to</em> <code>length</code> amount of
	 * data from <code>source</code>, placing it into the buffer at the given
	 * <code>index</code> and returning the final amount of data read from the
	 * <code>source</code>.
	 * <p/>
	 * It is possible that less than <code>length</code> data is read and
	 * written into the buffer.
	 * <p/>
	 * A return value of <code>0</code> indicates that the <code>source</code>
	 * has been exhausted (empty) and this {@link IInput} can now be considered
	 * "empty". Whatever remaining data it had is already contained within the
	 * buffer and all future <code>read</code> operations will return nothing.
	 * <p/>
	 * Two things can cause this method to read less data than requested by
	 * <code>length</code>:
	 * <ol>
	 * <li>The underlying <code>source</code> ran out of data before
	 * <code>length</code> amount of data was read. (e.g. stream)</li>
	 * <li>The amount of data remaining within this input (
	 * {@link #getRemaining()}), is less than <code>length</code>.</li>
	 * </ol>
	 * In the case of #1, the underlying <code>source</code> implementation will
	 * automatically limit the read data (e.g. streams). In the case of #2, the
	 * specific {@link IInput} implementation needs to enforce the limitation on
	 * the amount of data read to match {@link #getRemaining()}.
	 * <p/>
	 * <strong>NOTE</strong>: By the time this method is called, the values for
	 * {@link #getSource()} and <code>buffer</code> have been confirmed to be
	 * non-<code>null</code>. Also, <code>index</code> and <code>length</code>
	 * have been confirmed to be &gt;= 0.
	 * <p/>
	 * The only verification left for any implementation to do is ensure that
	 * <code>index</code> and <code>length</code> are valid bounds within the
	 * given <code>buffer</code>.
	 * 
	 * @param buffer
	 *            The destination for data copied from the <code>source</code>.
	 * @param index
	 *            The position in the buffer where new data from the
	 *            <code>source</code> will start to be written.
	 * @param length
	 *            The requested amount of data to be read from
	 *            <code>source</code> and written to the buffer (could end up
	 *            being less).
	 * 
	 * @return the amount of data read from the <code>source</code> and written
	 *         into the buffer. Returning a value of <code>0</code> indicates
	 *         that the <code>source</code> has been exhausted (empty) and has
	 *         no more data that can be read from it.
	 * 
	 * @throws IllegalArgumentException
