/**
 * Class used to implement an automatically retryable {@link Callable}.
 * <p/>
 * A task that fails and is deemed to be retryable (
 * {@link #canRetry(Exception, int, int)} returns <code>true</code>) is
 * automatically retried up-to <code>retryCount</code> number of times;
 * gradually increasing the wait-time between retries as determined by the
 * implementation of {@link #calculateRetryDelay(int, long, double)}.
 * <p/>
 * A task is considered successful if a call to {@link #callImpl(int)} doesn't
 * throw an exception.
 * <p/>
 * After the last retry attempt OR if {@link #canRetry(Exception, int, int)}
 * returns <code>false</code>, the task is considered to have failed and the
 * root exception is propagated to the caller in the form of a wrapping
 * {@link RuntimeException}.
 * <p/>
 * The {@link RuntimeException} message or {@link RuntimeException#getCause()}
 * return value will provide details about the failure type of the task.
 *

 * @param <V>
 *            The type of the object that {@link #callImpl(int)} implementation
 *            will return to {@link #call()} and {@link #call()} will return to
 *            the caller. In short, the result type of this task.
